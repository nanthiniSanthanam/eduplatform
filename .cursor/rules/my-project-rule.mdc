EduPlatform Project Rules (for AI/Dev/Chat Context)
Full-Stack Integrity:
Always check and maintain consistency between frontend forms, API services, backend models, serializers, views, and database fields for every feature or change.
Data Flow Awareness:
For any new or modified form, ensure the data flow is correct and complete:
Frontend Form → API Service → Backend Serializer/Model → Database
And for display: Database → Backend Serializer/View → API Service → Frontend Page
Field Matching:
All form fields must match backend requirements (name, type, required/optional, value format).
Use IDs for foreign keys (e.g., category_id), not names or objects, unless the backend expects otherwise.
Error Handling:
Add defensive checks for undefined/null data at every step.
Show user-friendly error messages for all API or validation errors.
Role & Access Control:
Always enforce and check user roles (student, instructor, admin) for protected routes and actions.
API/Model Changes:
Any change to backend models, serializers, or endpoints must be reflected in all connected frontend code and vice versa.
Testing & Navigation:
After any change, test the full navigation and data flow for both creation and display (for all user roles).
Documentation:
Add a timestamp and a brief comment at the top of every file you modify or create, describing the change.
Environment:
Always ensure the backend is running in the correct virtual environment (venv).
Linter & Naming:

Fix linter errors, especially those related to import casing and file naming, to avoid cross-platform issues.
